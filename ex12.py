# Section 12: Variable Naming

# Good naming
# bird_list = ["eagle", "sparrow"]
# for bird in bird_list:
#     print(bird)

# Exercise 12:
# Identify and fix poor variable names in a given code sample


# bad approach
# x = ["eagle", "sparrow"]
# for i in x:
#     print(i)


# good approach
# bird_list = ["eagle", "sparrow"]
# for bird in bird_list:
#     print(bird)
